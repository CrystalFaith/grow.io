  title@: "How it works"
  callouts:
  - title@: "Architect content"
    body@:
    - "Before writing any code, determine your site's content structure. Quickly and easily architect your content in lightweight YAML. Your data will become immediately available for you to use in templates."
  - title@: "Develop templates"

    - "Develop templates that bind to your content. Leverage Jinja2 templates to build pages based on your content structure. Keeping the content and the presentation separate makes maintenance and updates a snap."

    body@:
    - "Launches are simplified with Grow's deployment system. Grow builds your site to a static fileset and keeps track of files across deployments. If files are no longer part of the build, they're deleted upon deployment."
